# AllIn!

My project AllIn is the combination of an investment app and social media. The twist is that users are forced to invest all of their money into a single stock everyday. Ideally, if this was using real money, it would be more like a low-stakes game and everyone's starting balance is capped at something low like $5 and, the amount you can deposit per day is limited as well.

## Requirements

My project does not require any new packages that were not already needed for P4. The way to run it is by doing python manage.py runserver while inside the AllIn directory.

## Progress
Unfortunately, a bad bout of COVID in the second half of the work period for this project has significantly hindered my ability to work on improvements due to fatigue and headaches. So, the work I was able to do focuses mainly on the frontend side of the project so that one can better visually see the ideas I wanted to implement. For the most part, I was able to get all the pages to work, include most of the elements I wanted to add, and added some styling along the way. I also created variables for all of the values within the elements so it's not just hardcoded strings, though the variables themselves are not connected to the backend (though I did create a new model for accounts). 

My biggest regret on this project is not having been able to get the API to work. I was attempting to use the Finnhub API to get the stock price data, but for the life of me could not understand why I could not get it to work, though I'm sure the lack of experience with real API's played a part. So, I am submitting an older iteration of my code without the nonfunctioning API junk.

## Conclusion
Overall, I was very glad to have taken this class. It's fast paced nature along with some unfortunate timing has made it a little harder than I would have liked, but I'm glad to have started this journey with front-end software development as it's actually very enjoyable once the concepts start to click. I regret not having been able to finish this final project to the extent that I would like, but I did learn a lot from it and it's definitely given me the confidence to want to keep learning all about front-end development.
